    "The goal of image classification is to segment an image into different classes.  \n",
    "In this extension, we look at classifying an aerial photograph into four classes: Grass, Road, Roof, and Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by training a tree-based classifier on tagged sample images from the four classes.\n",
    "The classifier is then tested on an aerial photograph.\n",

    "Please note: the code is not optimised for speed; rather, it is designed for readability.\n",
    "**Beware**: The first code segment takes ~ 10-20 minutes to run and requires a large amount of memory (~5.5 Gb).\n",

    "The typical code and output is presented in a read only format at the following address:\n",

    "To explore the effect of changing code, training images, and test images, you will need to run it on your own device."
